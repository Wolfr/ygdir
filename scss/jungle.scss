/* ==========================================================================
   Jungle CSS framework
   --- 
  Jungle is a set of HTML and CSS components that can be used independently of each other,
  following the Ygdir convention, themed with a set of great defaults.
   ========================================================================== */

/*
  Jungle provides jungle-apps.scss and jungle-content-website.scss to give you an idea of
  the typical SCSS that would be used as a starting point for a content website or an app.

  Jungle.css ships with all Jungle components, for framework development reasons, but you should
  really strip away what you do not use in production.
